<div><p>Its a very simple card game! It's also known as "Ullae, Veliyae"..
</p>
<pre>The Game Requires:
*A deck of fair playing cards.
*Bet Money
</pre>
<pre>
The Gameplay:
*The player fixes a particular amount of money as the bet (Eg.: Say the player bets Rs.100)

* The player drags and drops a card from the deck.( Say he picks the 7 of spades) 

*The player drops cards onto his side("Ullae") and the com does the same for it's side("Veliyae").

*If the player gets the card of the same rank as that of the first card(a 7), before com, he wins... 
else he loses.

*Let's play Mankatha!

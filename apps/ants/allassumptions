the series of odd and even turn changes only if the either of the players place a card from the slots into a slots pile(different order of discard)
								or if either of them trade


priority one is to avoid attacks
	    two is to complete the draw
	     three is to attack
	     four is to have appropiate cards on slots
	     
	     therre and four depend on what the availabilty is
	     
	     
	     
	     priority is don't let be attack
					if current pos attack susceptible

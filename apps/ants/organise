		check for the wildcard
		
	<NO WILDCARD>
		
2.option of attack at this position------
		->(when i discard a card--if the next to next card is feasible for attack
					--do i have a reinforcements
					--
		
		
		
		->or i place a card at the slots---if the next to next card is feasible for attack		
					--do  have reinforcements
					
					
-- if attack at this position is great
			--go filling the nnext card using a adraw card --h=which is the highiest in probabality
			--if next card not present try the black-eyd jack
			no option available try to see reinfprmrnts
				--best reinformrnt-actual reinforce ments
				--then blackjack
				--then king
			theire is a mismatch here as the king may prove useful if i need king only far away or thier is immenet king but i can send the attacked card to the discard pile and iof two card of the same rank are close by  for thr user i n thethst good but dont try not to give a king at the discard if their is not ab=ny immenen6t king
			
			
			
			
			
			ATTACK
			omly if the current card is unavailable  and the no wildcard 
			two options left one discard
						two attack
					if the card in any of my drawn has already passed down the ranks sure attack
					if any card in my slots which has already been bypassed sure attack
					if a card which can be used as an attack and i need
										1.if immenet need see the stacks if empty place
										2.if no-else if see if u have aqueen and discard the by bypassed  cards from the stlot
										3.iif no by passed cards compare where u need the draw card if more lessrecently than any of the slot cards sure attack

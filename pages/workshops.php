Fencing is an up-and-coming sport that is gaining popularity among youngsters who are seeking new and exciting things to do. Fencing involves quick movements in offense and defense. Not only does it enhance mobility, balance and flexibility, it trains the mind in agility and tactility. It keeps the brain active and prevents cognitive decline or memory loss.
Little wonder, it is also known as a physical chess game!

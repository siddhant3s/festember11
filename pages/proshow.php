The Band has released two studio albums and three singles. Their debut album, Insane Biography included chart-busters such as “Maya” and “Soul Corporations” which had strong Indian musical elements, a trend that continues in all their later efforts. If the first was a trailblazer, the Band hit the jackpot with their second studio album, “Maktub”.
Feted as the “Album of the Year” for 2009 by Rolling Stone India, “Maktub” took Indian Rock to the World.
